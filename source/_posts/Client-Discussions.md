# Client Discussions.

#### New Brick-hill client Release Date? New coding language? How are developers reacting to this?

Brick hill has recently notified different users that the client is almost finished. This started to worry a lot of the current legacy developers who use Node-Hill. One of the worries were in fact about data saving.

Brick-Hill will deny server access to the developers. Meaning that Databases are not an option as developers would normaly do in node-hill (FS module). Currently most of the games that use data-saving use a Database or JSON files. Both of them still require Server access which is 100% denied to us in the new client. 

I myself asked jefemy what we were going to do, if developers would get Datastores (Virtual enviorments to save data without the need of Server access) and even proposed him to use memberships to expand data limit.

Jefemy replied explaining that something like that was being worked on. It was a relief for some of us. 

### Release Date.

Brick-hill users everyday ask a more less accurate release date of the client. The most accepted answer right now it's **2 months**. Still Dragonian and other administrators have said that it's unconfirmed and that the release date is not yet planned. 

This theory is boosted by a possible egg hunt on client release. And different users think that it will be released in 2 months for a halloween egg-hunt which would boost the user-base into using the client more.

### Node-hill Future.

Many Developers want node-hill to stay in the new client. Some of them, including myself would rather use node-hill in the new client rather than lua. This opinion is boosted thanks to the fact that **we** are the servers of our games. And that we can control anything in it. With the new client implementation we loose access to the core scripts and core features of the server that gave us a potential game-development tool. 

What will happen to node-hill?
